This directory contains version 1.0 release of the Python Bulk Image Converter.

DESCRIPTION
============================
I wrote this little program specifically to deal with all the screenshots I take with Fraps while playing games. Currently, the demo version of Fraps has this restriction in which all screenshots taken are in the BMP format, which takes up a lot of space compared to other formats, especially when you set it to automatically take screenshots at regular intervals.

USAGE
============================
1. First, select the image format you want the files to be converted to.
2. Second, click the "Load Files" button, navigate to the appropriate directory and then shift-click the files you intend to convert.
2a. It occurs to me that some people don't know how to select multiple files with the shift-click, so here's a quick how to: given any list of files in the
"open file" dialog, click on the first file at the top of the list. Next, scroll down to the bottom of the list, and hold shift, and click on the last file.
This will select all the files and folders from the beginning to the end. Entries you don't wish to include can be removed by holding shift+ctrl+clicking on each
file you wish to remove.
3. Verify in the main screen that all the files you've selected are correct.
4. Press "Convert" to convert each file. The new files will be placed in same directory as the originals, albeit with a different extension.
Use your file browser to sort through them.
